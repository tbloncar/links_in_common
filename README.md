Links in Common w/ Mozscape API
-------------------------------

Links in Common is a command line tool that makes use of [Mozscape API](https://github.com/seomoz/SEOmozAPISamples) requests. It attempts to emulate (crudely) the most basic functionality of Moz's Link Intersect Tool, which affords users the ability to track down links that two or more web properties have in common.
